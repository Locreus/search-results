This is a project where I make a webpage that looks like the google search results page.

--Finished 5/8/20--

What I learned:
Absolute and relative positioning make more sense now.
Images with no source defined give you annoying borders.

What gave me trouble:
Not much of anything, basic html layout is no trouble and css styling is fun.
Would like to learn more on svg images though.
